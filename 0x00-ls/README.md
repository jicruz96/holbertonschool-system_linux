# 0x00 C. - ls

This is the first project of the Holberton School Linux System section of the Low Level Systems, Algorithms, and Blockchain curriculum.

## What we did

In this project, we built our own custom version of the `ls` command from the ground up. Each file is an iterative improvement on our custom `ls` program. 

## How to use

Download this repository

```
$ git clone https://github.com/jicruz96/holbertonschool-system_linux.git
```

Change into the `0x00-ls` directory
```
$ cd 0x00-ls
```

Execute the hls file:
```
$ ./hls
```

Move the hls file to a folder within your PATH to use as terminal command
```
$ cp hls /usr/bin
$ hls
```

All other files are the program's source code, which you are free to verify or alter.
