/*
For this task, you will have to write 3 functions (all in the same file):

Create task

Prototype: task_t *create_task(task_entry_t entry, void *param);, where
entry is a pointer to the entry function of the task,
param is the parameter that will later be passed to the entry function
This function must return a pointer to the created task structure
Destroy task

Prototype: void destroy_task(task_t *task);, where
task is a pointer to the task to destroy
Execute task list - Thread entry

Prototype: void *exec_tasks(list_t const *tasks);, where
tasks is a pointer to the list of tasks to be executed
This function serves as a thread entry
This function can safely return NULL as its return value will not be retrieved
This function must go through the list of tasks and execute them, but thereâ€™s a challenge:
Multiple thread will be going through the list of tasks, and a task must only be executed once
You must use tprintf to print when a task is started, and completed
