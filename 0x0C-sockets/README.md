# 0x09 C - Sockets

This is the thirteenth project of the Holberton School Linux System section of the Low Level Systems, Algorithms, and Blockchain curriculum.

## What we did ğŸ¤”

**We built a simple HTTP Rest API in C.**

This API server has no persistent memory, but that's okay-- that's not the purpose of this project anyway. So... why?

## Why we did it: our learning objectives ğŸ’¡

Building a REST API from scratch in C gives us the chance to tangibly explore the following learning objectives:

* What is a socket and how it is represented on a Linux/UNIX system
* What are the different types of sockets
* What are the different socket domains
* How to create a socket
* How to bind a socket to an address/port
* How to listen and accept incoming traffic
* How to connect to a remote application
* What is the the HTTP protocol
* How to create a simple HTTP server
