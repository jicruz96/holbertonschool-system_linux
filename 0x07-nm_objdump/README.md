# 0x07 C - ELF: `nm`/`objdump`

This is the eighth project of the Holberton School Linux System section of the Low Level Systems, Algorithms, and Blockchain curriculum.

## What we did ðŸ¤”

In this project, we built our own **custom version of the `nm` and `objdump` commands** from scratch.


## Why we did it: our learning objectives ðŸ’¡ 

Building our own custom commands helps us take a deep dive into:

* The ELF format and what information can be extracted from an ELF file
* How to parse the content of an ELF file
* How to use `nm` and `objdump` them properly and how they differ
